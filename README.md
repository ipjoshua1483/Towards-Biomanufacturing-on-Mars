# Towards Biomanufacturing on Mars
This is a repository containing the ML models constructed from the variable gravity dataset for different organisms. 

A series of models are trained on growth and titer:

-Neural networks (NNs)

-Bayesian neural networks (BNNs)

-Bayesian neural networks with transfer learning (BNNs w/ transfer learning)

The NNs and BNNs are trained on HARV data collected on Earth, whereas the BNNs with transfer learning are models retrained on space data.
