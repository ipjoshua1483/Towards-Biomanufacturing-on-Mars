# Towards Biomanufacturing on Mars
This is a repository containing the ML models constructed from the variable gravity dataset for different organisms in the DARPA Biomanufacturing: Survival, Utility, and Reliability beyond Earth (B-SURE) project. 

A series of models are trained on growth and titer: Neural networks (NNs), Probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), and PNNs with transfer learning. The NNs and PNNs are trained on HARV data collected on Earth, whereas the PNNs with transfer learning are models retrained on space data.
